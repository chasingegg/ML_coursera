unsupervised learning   dimensionality reduction

K-Means algorithm: 1. cluster assignment  2. move centroids
distortion(cost function)

dimensionality reduction: data needs more disk space   bad performance on visualization
PCA(principal component analysis)  one of the compression algorithms
for instance: 2-dimension to 1-dimension  find a direction to minimize the projection error
PCA is not linear regression

how to implement PCA
data preprocessing
compute covariance matrix(sigma)
[U, S, V] = svd(sigma);
Z = U(:, 1:K)’ * X;

reconstruction from compressed representation

how to choose dimension K
average squared projection error / total variation in the data <= 0.01

PCA throw away some information, it’s bad to use PCA to prevent overfitting, we should use regularization. Another thing, first try running the original data, not to reduce dimension at the start.
