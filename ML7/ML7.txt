some changes to the logistic regression
an important feature: large margin classifier

kernel function(similarity function)
x(i)  ——>  f(i) ( sin(x(i), l(i) )
Gaussian kernel     large C -> high variance      large delta -> high bias

using a SVM
choice of parameter C
choice of  kernel

logistic regression vs SVM
if n >> m, or n is small and m is very large   logistic regression
if n is small and m is intermediate                SVM
