anomaly detection && recommender systems

anomaly detection: unsupervised learning
Gaussian distribution   mu, variance
anomaly detection algorithm
choose features Xi  
fit parameters mu, variance
given new example x, compute p(x), anomaly if p(x) < epsilon
some instances: fraud detection, manufacturing(aircraft engines), monitoring machine

multivariate Gaussian distribution  some features are correlated
automatically captures correlations between features
must have m > n, or sigma is non-invertible

recommender systems
collaborative filtering
iterations: theta -> x -> theta -> x -> theta -> x â€¦..
low rank matrix factorization
