advice for applying machine learning   machine learning system design

bias and variance(underfitting and overfitting)
training set / cross-validation set / test set

error with degree of polynomial
error with regularization
error with training set size(learning curve)

fix high variance: get more training examples/try smaller sets of features/try increasing lambda
fix high bias: try getting additional features/try add polynomial features/try decreasing lambda

error analysis  numerical evaluation
skewed class: a lot more of examples from one class than from the other class
sometimes accuracy is not very good to verify if the algorithm works well, we have another two things, precision and recall, precision = true positives/predicted positives
recall = true positives/actual positives     trade off precision and recall 
F1 score = 2 * P * R / (P + R)
